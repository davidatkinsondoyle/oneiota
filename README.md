# oneiota demo
Here is my demo code for csv to json parseing. Ive also included a small json api and Enber js application for viewing the data :-) 

##Notes on running
- can be run from any port number 
- must be run from inside "oneiota" folder!
- The Ember js app is a little slow becasue all of the product data is loading in on call, obviously this should be broken up for a live solution.

##Artitecture
/index.php - Ember Application
/controllers - controllers for data manipulation
/models - models or loading data and filter functions
/views - api endpoints that can be accessed in broser or via ember app

Thanks.
